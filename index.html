        <p>For all those times you stood by me<br>
            For all the truth that you made me see<br>
            For all the joy you brought to my life<br>
            For all the wrong that you made right<br>
            For every dream you made come true<br>
            For all the love I found in you<br>
            <br>
            I'll be forever thankful, baby<br>
            You're the one who held me up<br>
            Never let me fall<br>
            You're the one who saw me through<br>
            Through it all<br>
            <br>
            You were my strength when I was weak<br>
            You were my voice when I couldn't speak<br>
            You were my eyes when I couldn't see<br>
            You saw the best there was in me<br>
            <br>
            Lifted me up when I couldn't reach<br>
            You gave me faith 'cause you believed<br>
            I'm everything I am<br>
            Because you loved me<br>
            Oh, baby<br>
            <br>
            You gave me wings and made me fly<br>
            You touched my hand, I could touch the sky<br>
            I lost my faith, you gave it back to me<br>
            You said no star was out of reach<br>
            You stood by me and I stood tall<br>
            I had your love, I had it all<br>
            <br>
            I'm grateful for each day you gave me<br>
            Maybe I don't know that much<br>
            But I know this much is true<br>
            I was blessed because I was loved by you<br>
            <br>
            You were my strength when I was weak (you were my strength)<br>
            You were my voice when I couldn't speak<br>
            You were my eyes when I couldn't see<br>
            You saw the best there was in me<br>
            <br>
            Lifted me up when I couldn't reach<br>
            You gave me faith 'cause you believed<br>
            I'm everything I am<br>
            Because you loved me<br>
            <br>
            Oh, you were always there for me<br>
            The tender wind that carried me<br>
            A light in the dark<br>
            Shining your love into my life<br>
            <br>
            You've been my inspiration<br>
            Through the lies, you were the truth<br>
            My world is a better place<br>
            Because of you<br>
            <br>
            You were my strength when I was weak (you were my strength)<br>
            You were my voice when I couldn't speak (oh, when I couldn't speak)<br>
            You were my eyes when I couldn't see<br>
            You saw the best there was in me<br>
            <br>
            Lifted me up when I couldn't reach<br>
            You gave me faith 'cause you believed<br>
            I'm everything I am<br>
            Because you loved me<br>
            <br>
            You were my strength when I was weak (hey)<br>
            You were my voice when I couldn't speak (my voice)<br>
            You were my eyes when I couldn't see<br>
            You saw the best there was in me<br>
            <br>
            Lifted me up when I couldn't reach<br>
            You gave me faith 'cause you believed<br>
            I'm everything I am<br>
            Because you loved me<br>
            <br>
            Oh, I'm everything I am<br>

        <p>I can't sleep tonight<br>
            Wide awake and so confused<br>
            Everything's in line<br>
            But I am bruised<br>
            <br>
            I need a voice to echo<br>
            I need a light to take me home<br>
            I kinda need a hero<br>
            Is it you?<br>
            <br>
            I never see the forest for the trees<br>
            I could really use your melody<br>
            Baby, I'm a little blind<br>
            I think it’s time for you to find me<br>
            <br>
            Can you be my nightingale?<br>
            Sing to me, I know you’re there<br>
            You could be my sanity<br>
            Bring me peace<br>
            Sing me to sleep<br>
            Say you’ll be my nightingale<br>
            <br>
            Somebody speak to me<br>
            Cause I'm feeling like hell<br>
            Need you to answer me<br>
            I'm overwhelmed<br>
            <br>
            I need a voice to echo<br>
            I need a light to take me home<br>
            I need a star to follow, I don't know<br>
            I never see the forest for the trees<br>
            I could really use your melody<br>
            Baby, I'm a little blind<br>
            I think it’s time for you to find me<br>
            <br>
            Can you be my nightingale?<br>
            Sing to me, I know you’re there<br>
            You could be my sanity<br>
            Bring me peace<br>
            Sing me to sleep<br>
            Say you’ll be my nightingale<br>
            <br>
            I don't know what I’d do without you<br>
            Your words are like a whisper, come through<br>
            As long as you’re with me here tonight, I'm good<br>
            <br>
            Can you be my nightingale?<br>
            Feel so close, I know you’re there<br>
            Ooooh, nightingale<br>
            Sing to me, I know you’re there<br>
            Cause, baby, you’re my sanity<br>
            You bring me peace<br>
            Sing me to sleep<br>
            Say you’ll be my nightingale</p><br>

        <p>I fell from grace to the ground<br>
            To silence my rage without sound<br>
            Maybe I've always let me down<br>
            Maybe I've always let me down<br>
            <br>
            How did I end up here?<br>
            Why did I disappear?<br>
            Take me back to that place<br>
            Before I fell from grace<br>
            Lead me back to when love knew my name<br>
            <br>
            All that's left here are ghosts and roses<br>
            Echos are near, shadows closing<br>
            Maybe I've always let me down<br>
            Maybe I've always been upside down<br>
            <br>
            How did I end up here?<br>
            Why did I disappear?<br>
            Take me back to that place<br>
            Before I fell from grace<br>
            Take me back to when love knew my name<br>
            <br>
            Riding on flames and fire<br>
            Watching it all burn away<br>
            Done with thieves and liars<br>
            I know soon I'll be okay<br>
            If I ever find a love<br>
            Will it ever know my name?<br>
            <br>
            How did I end up here?<br>
            Why did I disappear?<br>
            Take me back to that place<br>
            Before I fell from grace<br>
            Before I fell from grace<br>
            Before I fell</p><br>

        <p>Come on, hold my hand<br>
            I wanna contact the living<br>
            Not sure I understand<br>
            This role I've been given<br>
            <br>
            I sit and talk to God<br>
            And He just laughs at my plans<br>
            My head speaks a language<br>
            I don't understand<br>
            <br>
            I just wanna feel real love<br>
            Feel the home that I live in<br>
            'Cause I got too much life<br>
            Running through my veins<br>
            Going to waste<br>
            <br>
            I don't wanna die<br>
            But I ain't keen on living either<br>
            Before I fall in love<br>
            I'm preparing to leave her<br>
            
            Scare myself to death<br>
            That's why I keep on running<br>
            Before I've arrived<br>
            I can see myself coming<br>
            <br>
            I just wanna feel real love<br>
            Feel the home that I live in<br>
            'Cause I got too much life<br>
            Running through my veins<br>
            Going to waste<br>
            <br>
            And I need to feel real love<br>
            And a life ever after<br>
            I cannot get enough<br>
            <br>
            I just wanna feel real love<br>
            Feel the home that I live in<br>
            I got too much love<br>
            Running through my veins<br>
            To go to waste<br>
            <br>
            I just wanna feel real love<br>
            And a life ever after<br>
            There's a hole in my soul<br>
            You can see it in my face<br>
            It's a real big place<br>
            <br>
            Come and hold my hand<br>
            I wanna contact the living<br>
            Not sure I understand<br>
            This role I've been given<br>
            <br>
            Not sure I understand<br>
            Not sure I understand<br>
            Not sure I understand<br>
            Not sure I understand</p><br>
